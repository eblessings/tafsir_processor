# Tafsir Processor

An advanced, memory-efficient processor for tafsir XML files. This tool parses complex, irregularly tagged tafsir files (with sura, aya, and footer elements) and applies sophisticated NLP analysis using NLTK and spaCy. The output is a refined, structured JSON file for each sura, designed to be easily re-parsed or extended.

 - ## Overview
   - This project processes tafsir files that are formatted in XML. The file is expected to contain a structure similar to the following:
               
                - ```xml
                  <qurantafseer name="Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi">
                    <sura index="1">
                      <aya index="0" text ="1. Surah Al Fatihah (The Opening) Name {surah-name-description-text} Theme {surah-theme-text}" />
                      <aya index="1-3" text="In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. {1} Praise is only for Allah, {2} the Lord of the Universe, {3} the All-Compassionate, the All-Merciful, {4} the Master of the Day of Judgment. {5}" />
                      <footer index="1" text="{verse(s)-commentary-text}" />
                      <!-- additional footer elements -->
                    </sura>
                    <sura index="2">
                      <!-- sura 2 content -->
                    </sura>
                    <!-- more sura elements -->
                  </qurantafseer>

                  The processor:

                  Uses lxml with recovery enabled to handle minor XML errors.

                  Extracts sura-level information (such as sura name, description, theme, historical background, and topics interconnection).

                  Processes each aya by extracting markers (e.g., {1}, {2}, ) and matching them with associated footer commentary.

                  Applies advanced NLP analysis using NLTK (for keyword extraction and frequency distribution) and spaCy (for named entity recognition and noun-chunk extraction).

                  Produces a refined JSON output file per sura, with all relevant metadata and analysis details.


                  Features

                  Robust XML Parsing: Uses lxml with recovery enabled to parse tafsir files even if there are minor XML errors.

                  Advanced NLP Analysis:

                  Extracts keywords, frequency distribution, named entities, and noun chunks.

                  Uses both NLTK and spaCy for deep language analysis.


                  Detailed Output: Each sura is output as a structured JSON file containing:

                  Sura-level metadata (name, description, theme, etc.)

                  Aya entries with raw text, cleaned text, markers, associated footers, and advanced NLP results.


                  Memory Efficiency: Processes files in a memory-conscious manner and includes garbage collection steps.


                  Directory Structure

                  A recommended structure for the project is:

                  tafsir_processor/
                   data/
                      maududi-tafsir.xml         # Your input XML tafsir file
                   output/                        # Generated JSON output files (e.g., sura_1.json)
                   logs/
                      tafsir_processor.log       # Log file for processing details and errors
                   src/
                      tafsir_processor.py        # Main processing script
                   requirements.txt               # Python dependencies list
                   README.md                      # This file

                  Installation

                  Prerequisites

                  Python 3.7 or later is required.


                  Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

                  1. Create a virtual environment:

                  python3 -m venv venv


                  2. Activate the virtual environment:

                  On Linux/Mac:

                  source venv/bin/activate

                  On Windows:

                  venv\Scripts\activate




                  Installing Dependencies

                  Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:

                  lxml>=4.9.0
                  nltk>=3.6.0
                  spacy>=3.0.0
                  en_core_web_sm>=3.0.0

                  Then run:

                  pip install -r requirements.txt
                  python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

                  Note: The script also downloads required NLTK corpora if they are not found on your system.

                  Usage

                  1. Prepare the Input File:
                  Place your tafsir XML file (e.g., maududi-tafsir.xml) in the data/ directory.


                  2. Run the Processor:
                  From the root directory of the project, run:

                  python -m src.tafsir_processor

                  The script will process the XML file, apply advanced NLP analysis, and write output JSON files to the output/ directory. Logging details will be written to tafsir_processor.log.


                  3. Review the Output:
                  Each sura is saved as a separate JSON file (e.g., sura_1.json, sura_2.json). Open these files to inspect the refined, structured output.



                  Advanced Analysis

                  The script uses:

                  NLTK to tokenize text, remove stopwords, build a frequency distribution, and extract top keywords.

                  spaCy for:

                  Named entity recognition (e.g., finding proper names, locations, etc.)

                  Extracting noun chunks.



                  The advanced analysis results are integrated into the output JSON for each aya. You can adjust regex patterns and NLP processing in the script (tafsir_processor.py) if your data requires further customization.

                  Uploading to GitHub

                  If you are new to GitHub, follow these steps to upload the project as a repository:

                  1. Create a New Repository on GitHub:

                  Click on the New Repository button.

                  Enter a repository name (e.g., tafsir-processor), add a description, choose public or private, and click Create repository.



                  2. Initialize Your Local Repository:

                  In your project folder, initialize a git repository:

                  git init


                  3. Add Files and Commit:

                  git add .
                  git commit -m "Initial commit of Tafsir Processor project"


                  4. Link the Local Repository to GitHub:

                  Replace <your-username> and <repository-name> with your GitHub username and repository name:

                  git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git


                  5. Push to GitHub:
